## Contribution Guidelines  

We encourage contributions to enhance this repository, whether by adding new languages, providing additional resources, or updating existing ones. Follow the guidelines below to contribute effectively:  

### Adding a New Language

1. Navigate to the `models` or `datasets` folder to locate the templates:
   - **Language Model Template**: [models/template.md](models/template.md)
   - **Dataset Template**: [datasets/template.md](datasets/template.md)

2. Create a new `.md` file for the language using the relevant template:
   - For language models: Save the file under `models/<language>.md`.  
   - For datasets: Save the file under `datasets/<language>.md`.  

3. Populate the template with relevant details, such as:  
   - For datasets: Include resources like language corpora, datasets for tasks such as question answering, sentiment analysis, machine translation, etc.  
   - For models: Add information about multilingual models (supporting the target language) or language-specific models and embeddings.  

4. Update this `README.md` file:  
   - Add the new language to the appropriate table under **Language Models** or **Language Resources**.  

### Updating Existing Resources

1. Locate the `.md` file for the language you want to modify:  
   - Language models: `models/<language>.md`  
   - Datasets: `datasets/<language>.md`  

2. Edit the file to include the new resources, updates, or corrections.

3. Ensure all additions are formatted consistently and adhere to the template structure.
